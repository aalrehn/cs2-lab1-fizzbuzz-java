1- a simple solution for n if it wasnt an argument would be a for loop because it would not change
2- I would have tested my solution by entering the input to see if it would display an error and if it does then I would try and catch exception
3-The logic of all the parts is the same because they do the same job. I think that the execution speed of the program would be faster depending on the implementaion.
